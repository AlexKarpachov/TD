# 3D Tower Defense Game

## Description
This is a fully functional **3D Tower Defense** game developed entirely by me over the course of approximately **1.5 months**. While most of the code and logic were written by me, a few scripts were adapted from various learning resources. Additionally, the map, in-game objects, and characters were downloaded from external sources.

The game involves strategically placing towers along a path to stop waves of enemies from reaching the player’s base, with different towers having unique abilities to counter different enemy types.

## Development Process
The longer development timeline was primarily due to my limited experience with **UI**, **shaders**, and handling more complex game logic, which required learning and experimentation throughout the process. The creation of this game served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to sharpen my skills in several areas of game development.

## Key Features
- **3D Environment**: A fully navigable 3D world with custom map and objects.
- **Tower Placement**: Players can place different types of towers along the enemy’s path, each with unique abilities and stats.
- **Enemy Waves**: Enemies follow a pre-defined route toward the player's base, and the challenge increases with each wave.
- **Basic UI**: Simple, intuitive interface allowing the player to manage resources and place towers.

## Skills & Experience Gained
Throughout the development of this game, I gained significant experience in:
- **Animation**: Creating and controlling animations for characters and towers.
- **UI Development**: Designing and implementing user interfaces to display resources, tower stats, and game progress.
- **Shaders**: Working with shaders to enhance the visual quality of the game and add special effects.

## Acknowledgments
- Several scripts were adapted from online learning resources.
- The map, objects, and character models were downloaded from various external sources to focus on the game's mechanics and overall functionality.

This project represents a significant step forward in my development as a game developer, combining many new skills into a functional and playable game.
